				  PURE AND VIEW					      
*************************************************************************************
-> pure and view we use to reduce the gas cost .
view -> we can read the state the variable , not modified the state variabl .

1. gas cost reduce .

if function is not as view -> some malicious person can change the state variable by finding some loop hole .
it has happened in blockchain , people who are using external smart contract .

2. security .

one smart contract also call the other smart contract .
view use when , c require only data for viw purpose .
pure -> when we dont want any other purpose cant be read and cant be modify the state variable .
A smart contract call by a person as well as another smart contract .

Note :-
view function declares that no state variable will be changed .
view function declares that no state variable will be changed or read .
data hiding -> abstrsction .
view -> partial  abstraction .
pure -> complte abstraction .

pure use -> when we not read the state or store on blockchain . it decreases the gas cost .

Gas cost only when called by a contract .
When we call pure and view by any personal / human account no gas cost required .

call by 0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db  =. gas will not be used in this cas .

gas will only charge when we modify some value .
